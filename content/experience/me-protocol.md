## Description

**Guide:** **Mr Paul Oamen** (CTO at Me-Protocol)

During my remote internship at [**Me Protocol**](https://meprotocol.io) (USA) as a Junior Software Engineer, I was exposed to the world of web-3 based software development. Me-Protocol is a decentralized platform for identity verification and data management using blockchain technology.

My main responsibilities involved developing and testing new features for the web platform using React.js and Next.js. I also worked on the backend side of the project using TypeScript and NestJS. In addition, I was responsible for writing efficient SQL queries for database management using PostgreSQL.

During the course of my internship, I learned how to work with remote teams and collaborate on projects using tools such as Github, Slack, and Trello. I also gained a deeper understanding of web development and blockchain technology.

Overall, my remote internship at Me-Protocol was a great learning experience and provided me with the opportunity to work on real-world projects with a talented and experienced team of developers.
